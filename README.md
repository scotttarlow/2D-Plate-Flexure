# 2D-Plate-Flexure
This is a finite difference model for 2-D plate flexure. 
Governing Equation given by Tourcotte and Schubert in section 3-9. 
Model solves for plate flexure through centered finite differences. B
oundary conditions are given in the code. 
Rigidity is manually set on each node, and vertical loads are represented by seamounts.
